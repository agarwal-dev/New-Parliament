# Replica of New Parliament of India â€“ AutoCAD & 3D Printing

## Project Overview
This project features a **3D replica of the New Parliament of India**, created using AutoCAD and fabricated through 3D printing. Developed as a club showcase for the **Independence Day exhibition (Aug 2024)**, the model emphasizes **architectural detailing**, **dimensional accuracy**, and **realistic proportions**.

The aim was to visually represent the structure and demonstrate CAD-to-physical translation skills through rapid, hands-on execution.

## Key Features
- 3D representation of the **New Parliament building** drafted in AutoCAD  
- Maintained architectural scale, symmetry, and visual accuracy  
- Completed end-to-end workflow: **CAD modeling to physical 3D printing**  
- Created as part of a club initiative for public display and awareness

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in **CAD drafting and 3D printing** workflows  
- Applied **architectural visualization principles** and scale modeling  
- Practiced **rapid execution**, completing the project in ~12 hours  
- Understood key aspects of **CAD-to-fabrication conversion**

## Tools Used
- **AutoCAD 2023**  
- 3D Printer  
- Filament  
- Slicing Software

## Files Included
- dwg file of the model
